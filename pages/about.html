            Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1997. They
            consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny
            Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative
            director Phil Harvey.[a] They met at University College London,
            initially calling themselves Big Fat Noises and changing to
            Starfish, before the current name. After independently releasing an
            extended play, Safety (1998), Coldplay signed with Parlophone in
            1999. The band's debut album, Parachutes (2000), included their
            breakthrough single "Yellow" and received a Brit Award for British
            Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album
            and a Mercury Prize nomination. Their second album, A Rush of Blood
            to the Head (2002), won the same accolades and included the single
            "Clocks", which won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Their
            third album, X&Y (2005), which completed what the band considered a
            trilogy, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album.
            Their fourth album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends
            (2008), won Best Rock Album. Both albums were the best-selling of
            their respective years, topping the charts in over 30 countries.
            Viva la Vida was also nominated for Album of the Year, while its
            title track became the first single by a British group to
            simultaneously reach number one in the United Kingdom and United
            States in the 21st century. Coldplay further diversified their sound
            over their next five studio albums, the most recent being Music of
            the Spheres (2021). Each album presented a unique theme and added
            new musical styles to the band's original repertoire, including
            electronica, ambient, pop, R&B, classical and progressive rock. They
            are also known for "euphoric" and "immersive" live performances,[3]
            which NME said are when the band "come alive and make the most
            sense".[4] In 2018, a career-spanning documentary directed by Mat
            Whitecross was released in select cinemas to mark the band's 20th
            anniversary. With over 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay
            are among the best-selling music acts of all time.[b] In 2014, Fuse
            ranked them as the sixth-most awarded group in history, which
            includes having the most Brit Awards wins by a band. They currently
            own three of the 50 highest-selling albums in the United Kingdom and
            the most number-one albums (nine) in the country without ever
            missing the top.[7] In 2021, "My Universe" made them the first
            British group to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. The
            band also have two of the 10 highest-grossing tours of all time.[8]
            Moreover, Coldplay are considered one of the "most influential and
            pioneering" acts in the world.[9] Forbes described them as a
            standard for the current alternative music scene, while the Rock and
            Roll Hall of Fame included A Rush of Blood to the Head on the 200
            Definitive Albums list and "Yellow" is part of their Songs That
            Shaped Rock and Roll exhibition, for being one of the most popular
            and influential recordings in the music industry. Despite their
            popularity and impact, however, Coldplay have earned a reputation as
            polarising music icons.
